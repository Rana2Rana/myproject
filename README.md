## Key Insights

- **Copiers** are the most profitable sub-category with over **$18M in profit**.
- **Bookcases** have high sales but relatively lower profit, suggesting a potential pricing or cost issue.
- **April and May** show the highest profit ratios, possibly due to optimized sales and discounts.
- Discounting trends show a fluctuating impact on profit ratios, indicating the need for smarter discount strategies.
- A few sub-categories have high sales but negative or very low profit margins.

## Analysis Conclusions

Based on the dashboard visuals and metrics, we can conclude the following:

- The high overall profit ratio (180.3%) indicates efficient cost management, especially in high-profit sub-categories like Copiers and Binders.
- Certain sub-categories (e.g., Bookcases and Tables) have high sales but low or negative profits, which suggests the need for reviewing pricing or supplier contracts.
- Discounts show a visible seasonal pattern, peaking around March to May, potentially linked to promotional campaigns. However, this doesn’t always correlate with higher profitability.
- The bubble chart clearly identifies sub-categories with low sales but high profit ratios, indicating potential for growth through focused promotion.

These findings help guide decisions in product portfolio management, discount strategies, and sales optimization.
