## üß† Analysis Conclusions

Based on the dashboard visuals and metrics, we can conclude the following:

- The high overall profit ratio (180.3%) indicates efficient cost management, especially in high-profit sub-categories like Copiers and Binders.
- Certain sub-categories (e.g., Bookcases and Tables) have high sales but low or negative profits, which suggests the need for reviewing pricing or supplier contracts.
- Discounts show a visible seasonal pattern, peaking around March to May, potentially linked to promotional campaigns. However, this doesn‚Äôt always correlate with higher profitability.
- The bubble chart clearly identifies sub-categories with low sales but high profit ratios, indicating potential for growth through focused promotion.

These findings help guide decisions in product portfolio management, discount strategies, and sales optimization.
